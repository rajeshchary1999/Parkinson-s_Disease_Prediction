PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
   
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a central nervous system degenerative disease that affects the quality of life of millions of seniors around the world. Because of the variability of the condition, symptoms of Parkinson's disease might progress differently from person to person. Patients with Parkinson's disease may experience tremors, which occur mostly during rest. Tremors in the hands, limb rigidity, and gait and balance issues are all possibilities. Generally, two types of symptoms of PD can be distinguished: movement-related (i.e., motor) and unrelated to movement (non-motor). Patients with non-motor symptoms are actually more affected than those with motor symptoms. Depression, sleep behavior abnormalities, loss of smell, and cognitive impairment are examples of non-motor symptoms. It should be mentioned that early discovery of Parkinson's disease allows for faster treatment and a significant reduction in symptoms. As a result, detecting PD at an early stage is critical for slowing its progression and, when available, may provide patients with the opportunity to receive disease-modifying therapy.
